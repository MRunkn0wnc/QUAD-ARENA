 

DESCRIPTION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

A seemingly innocent image was recovered from a suspect’s device. It looked like just another sunset — but agents believe it carries a hidden message.
Some say secrets aren’t always encrypted; sometimes they’re just... overlooked.
Can you uncover what’s quietly whispered between the pixels and beyond the frame?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

HINT : Sometimes what's hidden isn’t in the image — it’s around it. Check metadata.
