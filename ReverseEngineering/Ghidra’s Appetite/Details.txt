----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Something’s cooking in the binary… can you figure out what it loves to eat? This challenge hides a secret flag inside a compiled executable.
Use your reverse engineering skills to peek inside and reveal the truth. Don't trust what you see on the surface — true insight comes from disassembly.

HINT : Ghidra knows how to read binary — maybe you should too. Try digging through the verify function.

FLAG :-- QAr3na_CTF{R3V_B1NARY}
