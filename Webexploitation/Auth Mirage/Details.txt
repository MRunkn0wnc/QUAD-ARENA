----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
QuadArena has implemented a new "user integrity" system that promises zero impersonation.
But something feels... off.

You’ve been handed a normal user account. But a whisper in the source says someone’s watching from the top.

Can you *gain privileged access* and uncover what lies behind the locked terminal?
