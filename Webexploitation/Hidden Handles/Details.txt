----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The developers of a productivity app left an undocumented API endpoint during a late-night deployment.

It doesn’t appear in any documentation or frontend code, but it holds something sensitive—something flag-worthy.

HINT
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FIRST : -- The developers of a productivity app left an undocumented API endpoint during a late-night deployment. It doesn’t appear in any documentation or frontend code, but it holds something sensitive—something flag-worthy.

SECOND (only give it if no solves after a lot of time) : -- You’ve managed to register yourself into the app. But user-level access won’t cut it. The backend still trusts API calls blindly. Can you forge a request or manipulate the API behavior to access what's hidden from normal users?
