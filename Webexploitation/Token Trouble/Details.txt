 
DESCRIPTION

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The application claims to keep secrets safe and identities verified. But somewhere between trust and tokens, something doesn't quite add up.

The admin panel is said to be invincible — yet others have managed to sneak in.

HINT
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FIRST HINT : -- Sometimes, validation is just a formality… Check the assumptions behind every dot.

SECOND (only give it if no solves after a lot of time) : -- You have one cookie, and a locked door. No source code. No clues. Just trust issues.
